    <p><caption>One of my favorite movies of all times is "Inception" by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotllard from 2010.  The premise that a thought could be weaponized, placed in anotherâ€™s mind and, like a virus, take over and destroys the host on which it feeds, is as insidious and deadly -- and perhaps true as it sounds.  </caption></p>
