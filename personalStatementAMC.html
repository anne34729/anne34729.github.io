	<h1>My Background</h1>
	<p>
		My background and undergraduate degree is as an artist; I have a BFA in Illustration and Graphic Design from the Massachusetts College of Art. I've had a long and winding career from freelance illustration to web design and interaction design but never formal classes in web development. As a recent BC new hire and Woods College of Advancing Studies student in the Certificate Program in Information Technology, I was delighted to see that I can at last get formal training.

	<h1>My Interest in Web Development and What I Hope to Learn</h1>
	<p>
		Everything I know about web development has been entirely self-taught. This has had its limitations. Someone recently asked what APIs I'm familiar with and I had no idea what she was asking. I'm also unclear about responsive versus adaptive design and media queries. Furthermore, I rely almost entirely on jQuery and read that's going the way of the dodo-bird in favor of vanilla JavaScript - omething I'm not very good at. Finally, I don't know anything about CSS pre-processors, GitHub, or headless CMS. Hopefully, I can learn these things through this class.
	</p>
	<h1>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports, or Hobbies</h1>
	<p>
		Otherwise, I draw a lot in my spare time and challenge myself to do a drawing-a-day. I also knit and crochet and have a farm-yard of amigurumi, tiny crocheted creatures. I shake off the world by meditating and walking/running/hiking a great deal. I am really looking forward to this class.
