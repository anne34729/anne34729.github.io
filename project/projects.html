								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<p>Drawing and painting was my greatest joy since I was a wee-one. Consequently I was enrolled in many courses, the Museum School and art shows.  Subsequently, I attended the Massachusetts College of Art, majoring in Illustration and Graphic Design thinking to make it my profession. This was wise as I embarked on a wonderful career in digital design. Digital design morphed quite naturally to coding, another great opportunity for creative invention.  I've comtinued this study and will soon receive a Certificate in Information Technology from Boston College.
								<p>However sometime I sometimes muse about the alternative path, the life of a pure painter or fine artist  How would life have been different?  Could I have become great? More generally, can anyone on a planet of 8 billion people distinguish themselves as a artist?</p>
								<h2>Current Work</h2>
								<p>Uploaded here for your viewing pleasure are samples of work I have produced within the last 2-years.  These art and craft and professional projects are for various projects and in various medium, labelled and dated.  I'd be so happy to show my private reel and available to discuss your project whenever you are.  I'd love to bring your idea to life!</p>
